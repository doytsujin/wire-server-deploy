  # NOTE: this list could have been generated similar to ./kubernetes.inventory.tf, but
  #       Terraform thinks differently. While building up the dependency tree, it appears
  #       that it is not able to see indirect dependencies, e.g. local.cluster_machines.  #
  #       It fails at modules/aws-dns-records/resources.route53.tf resource aws_route53_record.spf.count
  #       with:
  #
  #         The "count" value depends on resource attributes that cannot be determined until apply
  #
  #       So, in order to work around this, a second output for public node IPs is being introduced.
